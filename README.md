# MealMatch: AI-Powered Meal Suggestion Tool

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

MealMatch is a simple AI-powered tool designed to suggest meal recipes based on the ingredients users already have at home. By reducing decision fatigue and promoting sustainability, MealMatch helps users make the most of their available resources while avoiding food waste. 


## Background

* Problem: People often find themselves wondering what to cook with the ingredients they already have in their kitchens. This leads to frustration, unnecessary food waste, or reliance on takeout. Without a system to suggest easy recipes, many ingredients go unused, contributing to global food waste.

* How Common Is the Problem? The issue is widespread in households worldwide, particularly for busy professionals, students, or individuals who lack cooking expertise.

* Personal Motivation: As a supporter of sustainability and simple solutions, I want to help people save time, money, and effort while minimizing food waste. MealMatch is a tool that can bring convenience to daily life and promote sustainable habits.

* Importance: Encouraging sustainability and reducing food waste are vital for combating global environmental issues. This project also improves users' cooking confidence and dietary variety.


## How is it used?

* Context and Users:

* Home Cooks: Quick recipe ideas for dinner without needing a trip to the store.

* Busy Professionals: Helps plan meals efficiently with minimal effort.

* Students: Easy access to simple, budget-friendly recipes.

* Affected Groups:

Direct Users: Benefit from reduced decision fatigue, reduced food waste, and improved meal planning.

Society: Encourages sustainable habits and reduces food waste.

   # solution

  The project doesn’t provide instructions for highly complex recipes or substitute unavailable ingredients.


## Data sources and AI methods
AI Techniques:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): To process user-inputted ingredients and match them to relevant recipes.

Recommendation System: Using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to suggest meals based on the input ingredients.

Classification Algorithms: To categorize recipes (e.g., vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.).

Optional Advanced Techniques: Fine-tuning a transformer-based language model for more personalized suggestions.

Demo Implementation:

A Python-based demo using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data preprocessing and matching.

Flask or Streamlit for a simple web interface where users input their ingredients and receive recipe suggestions.
## Challenges

What MealMatch Doesn’t Solve:

The project doesn’t provide instructions for highly complex recipes or substitute unavailable ingredients.

Limited to the quality and diversity of the recipe dataset used.

Potential Limitations:

Users may have rare or unusual ingredients not found in the dataset.

Requires accurate user input for optimal suggestions.

## What next?

Growth Opportunities:

Expand the dataset to include regional and cultural recipes for better diversity.

Add user feedback loops to improve recipe suggestions over time.

Integrate with voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant for hands-free suggestions.

Include nutritional information or calorie tracking for health-conscious users.

Create a mobile app version for broader accessibility.

## Acknowledgments
